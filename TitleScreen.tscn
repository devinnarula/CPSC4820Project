Suddenly - a local video game enthusiast has a brilliant idea.

He proposes to send representatives from each of the 4 warring countries to battle it
out fairly in a tournament, video-game style. The winning warrior will return to their
country and will be in charge of repairing the relations between the 4 countries.

The 4 countries agree to this idea. Warriors from Japan, Egypt, Greece, and Norwav
are sent to a video game tournament to battle out their differences.

4 civilizations.
4 warriors.
